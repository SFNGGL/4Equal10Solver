This is an automatic solver for the 4 = 10 Mobile Game App.

It can be extended to solve the other game by the same devolpers (24, 100, etc...)

The three main actions this app executes are:

1. Generate one valid expression consisting of 4 positive integers, the 4 operators of basic
arithmetics: +, -, *, / and 1 set of brackets.
2. Generate every single possible expression given 4 positive integers
3. Evaluates the one the amounts up to *10* (or any given positive integer, if possible).

Main app will likely come in the form of the main executable.
May consider creating a makefile and let user build it on their machine locally.
